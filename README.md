# Smart CLI Assistant (To-Do Manager)

**Author:** Mudita Songara

## 📜 Project Overview

This project is a simple, command-line interface (CLI) **To-Do Manager** developed in Python. It allows users to manage daily tasks directly from the terminal.

### Key Features
* **Task Management:** Provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for tasks (Add, View, Delete, Clear All).
* **Persistence:** Tasks are automatically saved to `todo.txt` and reloaded upon restarting the application.
* **Action Logging (Unique Feature):** Every significant user action (Adding, Deleting, Viewing, Exiting) is recorded with a **timestamp** in the `activity.log` file for auditing.
